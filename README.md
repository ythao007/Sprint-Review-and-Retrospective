"# Sprint-Review-and-Retrospective" 

How I interpret user needs and implement them into a program is by creating an analysis of the system, and asking for feedback, generally from a focus group and team. Creating user stories from the feedback we get from our focus group, the users, will help with what the customer wants, and we can then implement them into a program that will be useful and up to date with the users.

When developing programs, I ask for feedback and base what I do on what the customer wants. I also believe that empowering and motivating the team to create something of value is very important and that is something I would like to incorporate into my future development work.

To be a good team member in software development, one must follow the ethics of coding. Giving credit where due, helping others with their impediments when able, being honest with your abilities, and owning up to your mistakes are some of the things that a good team member can do.
